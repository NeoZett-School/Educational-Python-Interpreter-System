# Educational Python Interpreter System (EPIS)

Explore the power of EPIS: work with resolvers, parsing, interpreting, instructions, and environments.

**Note:** This interpreter was created for fun and exploration. It is designed to help you understand how interpreters work, rather than being optimized for performance. For high-performance interpreters or parsers, using bytecode or lower-level languages like C, Rust, or Go is recommended.

I would be excited to see you create your own language using this system, or research its mechanisms to build something new.

EPIS is **not a fully mature programming language**. It is meant strictly for educational purposes and experimentation. It should be used for learning and fun—anything beyond that is appreciated but not guaranteed.
